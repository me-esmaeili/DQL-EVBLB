# Load Balancing in Edge Networks

This repository contains codes and simulations related to research on load balancing in edge networks. The following articles form the basis of this research, and the results obtained from these simulations have been directly used in these articles.

## Articles

1. "EVBLB: Efficient Voronoi Tessellation-Based Load Balancing in Edge Computing Networks" - This article presents an optimized algorithm called EVBLB, which is based on Voronoi diagrams for load balancing. It introduces an innovative approach to evenly distribute the load across the network.

2. "Enhancing EVBLB with Reinforcement Learning: Q-Learning, Multi-Arm Bandit, and Gradient Bandit Algorithms" - The second article develops the EVBLB algorithm further and addresses its challenges by presenting three reinforcement learning-based algorithms: Q-Learning, Multi-Arm Bandit, and Gradient Bandit (GB). These algorithms aim to optimize load balancing dynamically in response to environmental changes.
